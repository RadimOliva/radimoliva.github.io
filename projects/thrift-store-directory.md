# Thrift store directory
<span class="datum">May 20, 2025</span>
I set out to create a simple web and mobile app that will list out local second hand stores in a pleasant, easy to view way. That's about it for now. I have more ideas on various features that could be added but for now I'll be happy if I manage to just produce this basic concept.  
Frankly I have no clue how app development works so I'll have to find that out.

ChatGPT prompt: 
I want to make a simple online directory app that will show local second hand stores in my area. The app should be available first only as a web app but later I'd like to do a mobile variant (IOS + Android). It will just be a zoomable map with the available shops placed in it. Once you click on a shop it will open a pop up window with some detail of the shop (opening hrs, address, phone number, description). I have no knowledge about app development and this serves as a learning project. I want you to write me a complete road map of how this is done, start to finish. Over-explain everything, if you use a technical jargon include an explanation of that particular term, approach this as you would instruct a person with no prior knowledge. I want to know how one should approach building such an app, debugging, making it live and available, maintaining it and expanding it with further features. This is a solo project, I will do everything myself, nothing will be delegated or made it a team. I want to know how much this will cost in terms of operational costs (servers, support etc.).
