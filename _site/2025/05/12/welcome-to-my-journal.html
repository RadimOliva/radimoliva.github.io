    <p>This is my first journal entry.</p>

<p>After much deliberation and putting things off into the foggy distant future I have finally decided to create something of a personal website, something I should have done very long time ago, nevertheless here it is. I don’t really have a set goal or idea of what this should be but the fact of making my journal public somehow gives more validity or realness, at least in my mind. I have already began journaling about a year ago, physically with pen and paper, a process which in itself is very satisfying and feels more personal and grounded in reality, however at the beginning of this year I have switched to journaling on a computer almost exclusively because it is just so much faster to write down my thoughts and iterate or edit sentences as I go. 
I have very rarely journaled or written anything before that in my life which is a shame, really, I’ve found it really helps one’s ability to formulate ideas and become more articulate, something Jordan B. Peterson often points out in his lectures and talks. That’s one of my main reasons to write down my thoughts, I want to practice formulating my thoughts and thinking as deeply as I can about each and every one of the words that came on the screen or paper.</p>
