    <p>I was pouring concrete sidewalk next to house today, did a big chunk of it. Did some minor things in the house as well. Drank a lot of caffeine. Throughout most of this I had my earphones and listened to several interviews with founders. The guy who founded Airbnb, Brian Chesky (I just Googled to find out meaning behind the company name, that’s how I know his name, otherwise I wouldn’t remember to save my life), the young fellow who founded Cursor AI, the slightly older man who founded Notion and maybe someone else as well who I can’t recall right now. Is this habit of listening to podcasts just a noise that keeps me company? I am trying to recall some valuable insights from those hours of listening. To be fair I had to aim some of the attention to the concrete pouring. I should probably give the Notion app some more chance. There are so many tools for just about everything. It’s all so overwhelming. I’m still so doubtful in my ability to step out from my shadow. Yeah, so I have doubts. Big deal. I’ve lied today to that fucking doctor at the clinic where I’ve signed up to participate in a clinical trials for cash. She asked If I’ve ever had suicidal thoughts and I said ‘course not. Who the fuck doesn’t have suicidal thoughts? There are such people? Fucking weirdos. Fuck you if you read this by the way, because why not. Back to the topic of me trying to remember what I have been listening to all day… Michael from Cursor believes the future of coding is in logical design rather than being in the trenches of trying to figure out the proper code. I like the sound of that, the crude engineering work being outsourced to the AI agents so that I can focus on the product design itself. He said the company has around 60 employees and Lenny mentioned the ARR makes it the fastest growing company in history. What were the two things Michael would recommend to people who just started using Cursor? I can’t pull it out. At least I remember something from Justin Song whom I’ve listened to on the way to Doksy. It was my third run on his take on encoding. Encoding is turning the consumed information into knowledge. Without it you just have crude memorization (which by itself is useless if you don’t know how to apply the information). The most important parts that I can recall are simplifying, boil down everything into the simplest terms, compare it to what you already know so that you can then properly categorize it, without knowing how the newly acquired information relates to other things and where (what book shelf - the library analogy) it fits in the big picutre your brain will have hard time saving the information for later use. Making analogies is a great way to achieve simplification, comparation and using the information in a practical way greatly enhancing the ability to understand key concepts. I need to learn how to make the analogies cause I probably never made a single one. Shame. Anyway it’s getting late and I need to get some sleep. Later.</p>
